# Clustering-of-Dolphin-Clicks
Ongoing Project

Dataset was collected by Yotam Zuriel, Phd candidate researching marine mammals behaviour and habitat.
The initial target is to  cluster the recorded data  so we could differentiate species or behaviours differences.
I found a way to visualize clusters "signatures" and now were in the process of analysis - cluster validation using inner
density and pairwise distance, and manual analysis with Yotam. 

The notebook is changing from time to time with progress.

When clustering will be determined, an Automated classification is the second target.
